================================================================================
THIRD-PARTY COMPONENTS AND GPL ISOLATION
================================================================================

This software uses a process-isolated architecture to maintain MIT licensing
while utilizing GPL-licensed components:

1. MAIN APPLICATION (MIT Licensed):
   - Frontend (React, TypeScript)
   - Backend API (FastAPI, Python)
   - AI Integration (CopilotKit)
   - Plugin Management
   - Audio Analysis
   - User Interface

2. ISOLATED ENGINE PROCESS (GPL Licensed):
   - DawDreamer audio engine (GPLv3)
   - Real-time audio processing
   - Plugin hosting
   - Audio rendering

The main application communicates with the engine process through IPC
(Inter-Process Communication) using pipes and shared memory. This creates
a clean legal boundary that prevents GPL contamination of the main codebase.

IMPORTANT LICENSING NOTES:
- The main application (this repository) is MIT licensed
- The engine process contains GPL components and must be distributed separately
- Users who wish to use the full system must comply with GPL terms for the engine
- The main application can function without the GPL engine using mock implementations

For commercial licensing options or questions about GPL compliance,
please contact: legal@schillinger-audio.com
