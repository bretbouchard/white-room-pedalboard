The compilation errors shown in build output are unrelated to these components and concern other parts of the system (automationManager references in DAWMainComponent).\n\nThe pattern editing workflow is now fully restored with:\n- Complete PatternActionHandlers for copy/mutate/morph/link operations\n- Progressive editing layers for basic/advanced/expert pattern control\n- EditorSelector for choosing appropriate editing interfaces\n- Style preset browser integration for advanced morphing capabilities\n\nComponents are ready for integration with the professional DAW's advanced pattern editing workflow.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-09T21:27:02.312187-05:00","updated_at":"2025-11-09T21:31:26.899529-05:00","closed_at":"2025-11-09T21:31:26.899533-05:00"}
