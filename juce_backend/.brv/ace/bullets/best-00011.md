Physical modeling feedback loops MUST use soft clipping (std::tanh) to prevent runaway oscillation. ALWAYS hard limit feedback amount to < 0.95. Use Direct Form II biquad for modal filters (most efficient). Prevent denormals by adding 1e-10f offset to state variables. See KANE_MARCO_AETHER_RESEARCH.md Section 6.1 for stability tests.
