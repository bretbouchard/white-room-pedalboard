SynthEngine architecture uses feel vector control system mapping 5D rubber/bite/hollow/growl/wet parameters to DSP. Agent system integration made optional with LOCAL_GAL_NO_AGENTS preprocessor flag for build flexibility. Pattern bank refactored from direct MAX_PATTERNS to Pattern::MAX_PATTERNS namespace for proper encapsulation.
