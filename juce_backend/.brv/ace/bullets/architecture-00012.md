Modal frequency distribution strategies for physical modeling: 1) Harmonic (wooden bodies): f₀, 2f₀, 3f₀... 2) Inharmonic (metallic): fᵢ = f₀ × sqrt(1 + B × i²) where B=0.01-0.02. 3) Measured data from real instruments (most authentic). 4) Stochastic for ambient textures. Recommended hybrid: modes 0-3 harmonic (warmth), modes 4-31 inharmonic (shimmer), exponential decay (higher modes decay faster). Full pseudocode in KANE_MARCO_AETHER_RESEARCH.md Section 5.
