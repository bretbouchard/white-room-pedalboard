Kane Marco Aether physical modeling synthesizer uses modal synthesis with 32 resonant modes per voice (2nd-order biquad filters), exciter-resonator architecture with feedback loop, SVF multimode filter, and ambient reverb. Estimated CPU: ~6% for 16 voices at 48kHz. Key components: Exciter (noise burst + envelope), ResonatorBank (32 modal filters), FeedbackLoop (with tanh saturation for stability), StateVariableTPTFilter (JUCE built-in).
