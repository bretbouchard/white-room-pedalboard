Lock-free modulation matrix pattern: Use std::atomic<float> arrays for modulation amounts accessed from audio thread. Update from UI thread via atomic.store(), read from audio thread via atomic.load(). Pre-allocate routing arrays to avoid heap allocation. Supports 16-slot modulation with sources (LFOs, ENVs, macros, velocity, aftertouch) and destinations (all automatable parameters). Realtime-safe, no locks needed.
