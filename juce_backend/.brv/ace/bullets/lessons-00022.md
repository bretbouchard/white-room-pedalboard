Kane Marco Family Week 2 Complete: All 3 instruments hit Week 2 targets. Kane Marco: FFI bridge DONE (1,700 lines, 33 functions, 8 macros + 16-slot mod matrix, Swift integration ready). Kane Marco Aether: 8-mode resonator bank DONE (equal-power normalization, mode skipping, 8 tests, TDD GREEN phase). Kane Marco Aether String: Articulation FSM DONE (fixed all JUCE API errors, 6-state FSM, 4 exciters, 10/10 tests passing, 82% total pass rate). Total: ~3,500 lines Week 2 code. All instruments on track for 6-7 week delivery.

JUCE Backend Cleanup Phase 8: Complete remaining CMake configuration fixes to enable tvOS local-only builds. Main epic: audio_agent_tree_1-84 with 7 sub-tasks (audio_agent_tree_1-85 to audio_agent_tree_1-91). Blockers: WebAPIIntegrationTest and PerformanceLoadTest TARGET guards, comprehensive CMake audit needed.
