Oscillator warp algorithm for Kane Marco: phase_warped = phase + (warp * sin(2π * phase)), where warp ranges from -1.0 (negative phase delay) to +1.0 (positive phase advance). Apply PolyBLEP anti-aliasing to all waveforms (SAW, SQUARE, TRI, PULSE). Warp modifies phase accumulation before waveform generation, creating unique timbral transformations.
