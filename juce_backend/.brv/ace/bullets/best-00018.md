Physical modeling string synthesis: Use juce::dsp::DelayLine with Lagrange interpolation for fractional delay (smooth pitch tracking). Stiffness filter (allpass) adds inharmonicity - keep coefficient < 0.5 for stability. Damping filter (lowpass) uses juce::dsp::FirstOrderTPTFilter for zero-delay feedback. Modal body resonator: 8-16 biquad modes per voice, each with frequency, amplitude, decay time parameters. Guitar body preset modes: 95Hz (air), 190Hz (top), 280Hz (back), 400Hz (Helmholtz), 580Hz, 850Hz, 1200Hz, 1800Hz.
