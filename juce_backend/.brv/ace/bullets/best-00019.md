Pedalboard architecture: Use juce::dsp::Compressor<float>, juce::dsp::Phaser<float>, juce::dsp::Reverb for built-in effects. Custom RAT distortion with switchable diodes: Silicon (0.7V threshold), Germanium (0.3V, softer asymmetry), LED (1.5V). Use asymmetric clipping with std::tanh() and pre-filter @ 4kHz, tone filter (user-adjustable). Octave pedal: time-domain pitch tracking (simpler) or FFT-based (higher quality). Pedal routing: array-based ordering, enable/disable per pedal, thread-safe parameter updates via std::atomic<float>.
