# Current Status — quick snapshot (auto-generated)

Date: 2025-09-26

Summary:

- Git submodules: `daid-core` and `sdk` synchronized and initialized locally.

- `daid_core` shim import: SUCCESS (`src/daid_core/__init__.py` loaded).

- Schillinger-focused pytest run: PASSED (all tests matching "Schillinger" passed).

- Coverage: Project total coverage: 23.16% (required 20% reached). Many core modules have low coverage; see coverage report `htmlcov/` for details.

Actionable notes:

- Create `docs/implementation_plan.md` (this file references the plan) and `docs/current_status.md` to track remediation progress.

- Next steps: run focused integration tests that previously failed, fix small regressions, and create PRs for fixes.
