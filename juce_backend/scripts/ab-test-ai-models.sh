# In a real scenario, this script would:
# 1. Deploy different versions of AI models (e.g., Model A, Model B) to different user groups.
# 2. Collect metrics and feedback for each model (e.g., suggestion acceptance rates, user satisfaction).
# 3. Analyze the results to determine which model performs better.
# 4. Promote the winning model to all users.
