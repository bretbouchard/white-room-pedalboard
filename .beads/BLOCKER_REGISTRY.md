## 🚨 ESCALATION PROCEDURES

### Severity Levels

**🔴 CRITICAL**
- Launch blocking
- Multiple conditions affected
- Immediate escalation required
- Update every 2 hours

**🟠 HIGH**
- Single condition blocked
- Workarounds available
- Daily updates required
- Escalate if not resolved in 24 hours

**🟡 MEDIUM**
- Partial impact
- Mitigations in place
- Daily updates
- Escalate if not resolved in 3 days

**🟢 LOW**
- Minor impact
- No workaround needed
- Updates in daily standup

### Escalation Chain

1. **Condition Owner** (immediate notification)
2. **Project Shepherd** (within 2 hours if critical)
