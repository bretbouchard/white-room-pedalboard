{"id":"white_room-198","title":"Synth Output Normalization - All 6 instruments at -6 dB peak","description":"Normalize all 6 synth output levels to -6 dB peak with zero clipping.\n\n## Problem\nInitial testing showed 47 dB variation between synths:\n- LocalGal: 0 dB (clipping)\n- KaneMarco: -15 dB mean\n- KaneMarcoAether: -16 dB mean, 0 dB max (clipping)\n- DrumMachine: -47 dB mean (barely audible)\n- NexSynth: -5 dB mean (good)\n- SamSampler: -6 dB mean, 0 dB max (clipping)\n\n## Root Causes Discovered\n\n### 1. Stale Test Binaries (Critical Lesson)\nTest binaries were not rebuilt after header changes. Old binaries had masterVol=1.0 while headers had 0.25.\nLESSON: ALWAYS rebuild test binaries after header changes. Verify by checking actual runtime values.\n\n### 2. Missing Voice Normalization\nLocalGal summed voices without normalization, causing clipping when multiple voices active.\nSolution: Added voice normalization (divide by activeCount)\n\n### 3. Envelope Release Time Mismatch\nLocalGal had 2.0s release vs KaneMarco's 0.2s (10x difference).\nImpact: Mean levels appeared low due to long release during sequential test timing.\n\n### 4. Multi-Stage Attenuation (KaneMarcoAether)\nMultiple gain stages compounded:\n- Excitation: 0.8x\n- Voice normalization: 0.41x (1/sqrt(6))\n- Bridge coupling: 0.3x\n- Total: -28 dB attenuation\n\n## Solutions Implemented\n\n### LocalGal\n- Envelope release: 2.0s → 0.2s (match KaneMarco/NexSynth)\n- Header default updated\n- applyFeelVector() updated\n\n### All Synths\n- Master volume levels adjusted\n- Voice normalization added where missing\n- Fresh test binaries built with clang++\n\n## Final Results\nAll 6 synths at EXACTLY -6.02 to -6.03 dB peak:\nLocalGal: -25.59 dB mean, -6.02 dB peak, 0 clipping\nKaneMarco: -9.78 dB mean, -6.02 dB peak, 0 clipping\nKaneMarcoAether: -20.14 dB mean, -6.02 dB peak, 0 clipping\nDrumMachine: -37.08 dB mean, -6.03 dB peak, 0 clipping\nNexSynth: -14.53 dB mean, -6.02 dB peak, 0 clipping\nSamSampler: -10.92 dB mean, -6.02 dB peak, 0 clipping\n\n## Lessons Learned\n1. Always verify runtime values - header changes don't rebuild binaries\n2. Voice normalization critical - prevent clipping with polyphony\n3. Envelope timing affects mean levels - long release = low mean in sequential tests\n4. Peak normalization preferred - mean varies by envelope, peaks are consistent\n5. 47 dB reduced to \u003c30 dB variation in mean levels\n6. Test timing matters - sequential vs sustained notes affects results\n\n## Files Modified\n- LocalGalPureDSP.h/cpp (envelope release 2.0s → 0.2s)\n- KaneMarcoPureDSP.h (masterVolume adjustments)\n- KaneMarcoAetherPureDSP.h/cpp (multi-stage gain fixes)\n- NexSynthDSP.h (masterVolume 0.7 → 1.2)\n- SamSamplerDSP.h (masterVolume 0.7 → 1.1)\n- DrumMachinePureDSP.cpp (voice levels ×4)\n\n## Documentation\nCreated NORMALIZATION_REPORT.md with full details.\n\n## Commits\n- d04044e docs: Add synth normalization report\n- df3697b fix: LocalGal envelope release time\n- 4ca281f fix: Disable parameter telemetry for JUCE 7\n- ab123b1 feat: Normalize synth output levels to -6 dB target","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-13T23:44:49.323587-05:00","updated_at":"2026-01-16T02:37:10.27227-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-13T23:45:23.279264-05:00"}

LocalGal builds successfully in VST3 format\n2. LocalGal builds successfully in AU format  \n3. LocalGal builds successfully in CLAP format\n4. All plugins install to correct system directories\n5.
