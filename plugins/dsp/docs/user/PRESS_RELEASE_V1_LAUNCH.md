### About Schillinger System

Joseph Schillinger (1895-1943) was a Russian-born American composer and music theorist who developed a comprehensive mathematical system of music composition. His work, published in the 1940s, has influenced generations of musicians, including George Gershwin, Benny Goodman, and many others. The Schillinger System treats music as a branch of mathematics and science, providing algorithmic approaches to rhythm, harmony, melody, and orchestration.

White Room v1.0.0 is the first software to fully implement all components of the Schillinger System in a practical, accessible Digital Audio Workstation.
